<h2>Exploit Development Workshop</h2>

The Course teaches you on how to analyse and hunt for vulnerabilities and crafting your
own exploit script to gain a shell of the system. We will be targeting Windows 7 and
Windows 10 OS to writing your own exploits. The instructor will also share his past
experience in writing exploits and the hurdles in fuzzing the applications for detecting a
vulnerability and finally crafting your own working exploit to gain SYSTEM.
At the start of the session, we will be kicking off with understanding the different point
attack for developing your own exploit. As, the session progresses, we will be looking into
multiple ways into writing an exploit.

<h2>Target Audience</h2>

This session would be helpful for students intending to learn to write their own exploits and
bug hunters trying to detect vulnerabilities in the application level. The session would also
help to red teamers and professional penetration testers in creating a foundation in exploit
writing. Students planning to take up the OSCP and OSCE examinations would benefit the
most out of this session.

<h2>Deliverables</h2>
<ul>
<li>Training slides and study material (PDF).</li>
<li>All the scripts and tools that are used during the training.</li>
<li>Curated list of applications that can be used as testbeds while learning exploit
scripting.</li>
</ul>>

<h2>Requirements</h2>
<ul>
<li>Laptop with Minimum 70 GB Hard Disk space and 4GB RAM</li>
<li>Virtual Box Installed</li>
</ul>

<h2>Topics to be covered</h2>
<ul>
<li>Buffer Overflow attacks by Vanilla EIP Overwrite</li>
<li>Attacking SEH chains</li>
<li>Buffer Overflow by egg hunting</li>
<li>Using Windows Custom shellcoding</li>
</ul>

<h2>What you will get from this session :</h2>

At the end of the session, the attendees would be given two apps and theyâ€™d be
expected to write their own working exploit scripts to root the Windows machines.
