BUG BOUNTY Village is a platform for bug bounty researchers and Infosec professionals to come and share their experiences. It's an apt place to learn bug bounty, report writing, teach and learn from others. With a series of talks/trainings and awards, we want to bring this fun platform to everyone.

Bug Bounty village includes two things :

The first one is “Unique Bug of the Year award / Best Bounty Hunter of the Year”. It aims to motivate and encourage researchers to write good and effective vulnerability reports. More interestingly if your vulnerability/ bug finding report gets duplicate ,do not worry, be happy, as we will also consider the duplicate reports in the submission. We understand how much time and effort a researcher/bug bounty hunter puts into finding a bug/vulnerability.

The second is “Talks and Workshops”. It aims at sharing knowledge with the bug bounty hunters and security community people who are already in Infosec field/ getting-started/ want to start a career in information security domain.
