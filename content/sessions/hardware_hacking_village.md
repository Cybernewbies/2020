<h2>Build your own hacking gadgets</h2>

<b>What:</b> Learn how to build your own hacking gadgets, a hands-on workshop on building a WiFi Deauther & a Bad USB, as you dive into the Arduino project and your first micro-controller. How to build the following devices. 1. BAD USB 2. WiFi Jammer/Deauther

<b>HOW:</b> groups will be made and provided with an ESP 8266 and a Digispark module. Attendees will get hands-on experience on programming a micro-controller and will get to take home their new WiFi Deauther and Bad USB.

<b>WHY:</b> This workshop introduces the audience to micro-controllers & hardware, disproves some of the myths about hardware being complicated. The author of the workshop has experience building control system for UGV/UAV and other embedded systems. 



Scan for WiFi devices, block selected connections, create dozens of networks and confuse WiFi scanners! built around a ESP 8266 microcontroller, more about this project over at https://github.com/spacehuhn/esp8266_deauther 

<b>Note:</b> The Village will run till the time Hardware is there.
