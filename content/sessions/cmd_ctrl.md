Want to test your skills in identifying web app vulnerabilities?  Join OWASP Las Vegas and Security Innovation as members compete in CMD+CTRL, a web application cyber range where players exploit their way through hundreds of vulnerabilities that lurk in business applications today.  Success means learning quickly that attack and defense is all about thinking on your feet.

https://si-community.hubs.vidyard.com/watch/JCH8L2Ym4WXB7cNCb3izcr

For each vulnerability you uncover, you are awarded points. Climb the interactive leaderboard for a chance to win fantastic prizes! CMD+CTRL is ideal for development teams to train and develop skills, but anyone involved in keeping your organizationâ€™s data secure can play - from developers and managers and even CISOs.

<b>NOTE:</b> Just bring your computer and evil inner-doer and you are ready to roll!
