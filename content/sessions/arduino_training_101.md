Arduino is an open hardware development board that can be used by tinkerers, hobbyists, and makers to design and build devices that interact with the real world. The board can be programmed to do anything by simply programming the microcontroller onboard using an inbuilt programing language called Arduino.

Arduino can operate either independently (like in a robot), connected to a computer, or connected to other Arduinoâ€™s, or other electronic devices and controller chips. Pretty much anything can be connected and is bounded only by your imagination. Arduino gives intelligence to your circuit or your design. It can take input from sensors, understand the data and do assigned tasks. 

The main aim of this training program is to educate people on Coding & Developing real-world applications using Arduino.
