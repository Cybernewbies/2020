<h2>BLE UAE (Understanding And Exploiting)</h2>

BLE â€“ Bluetooth low energy is current trend in communication for the IoT devices, it will help to control the device and sharing, receiving the information there are two differences in the Bluetooth 

1. Classic bluetooth 
2. Smart Bluetooth called as BLE
