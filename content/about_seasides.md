Welcome to the Annual OWASP SeaSides InfoSec Conference. 

Through OWASP Bangalore chapter we aim to provide free of cost premium workshops and talks to all the participants. We plan to have Workshop on 3rd to 5th March 2020 (9:00 AM to 5:00 PM).

nullcon has been doing a great job getting researchers from all over the world to India. If you are coming for nullcon 2020 then we are giving you more reasons to come early and participate in OWASP and null community events.
